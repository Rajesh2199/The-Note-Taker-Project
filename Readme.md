## Description
This is an application that allows users to write, and modify notes based on their needs. This application is built using Express.js and Node.js features as it utilizes the concepts behind ports, basic routes, api routes, and read and write file functionality.

## Challenges
Understading the routing and api concepts was particularly challenging for me and I have to admit I still do not have a clear understanding how everything works together to make an application work. I continue to do more reasearch on this specific topic and plan on tackling this project again once I gain a full understanding of Express.js.
