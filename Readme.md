## Description
This is an application that allows users to write, and modify notes based on their needs. This application is built using Express.js and Node.js features as it utilizes the concepts behind ports, basic routes, api routes, and read and write file functionality.

## Challenges
Understanding the routing and api concepts was particularly challenging for me. After investing significant amount of time learning about methods like get, post, and delete I was able to make this application fully functional. The application is up and running in heroku and you can access the app via link provided above.
